# CHATBOTPHP
This project showcases a chatbot web application developed using a combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot utilizes a database to store predefined responses based on user inputs. When a user sends a message, the chatbot searches the database for a matching query and responds accordingly.
